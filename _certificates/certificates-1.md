I have successfully completed the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate Program, an intensive series of 9 courses designed to build a strong foundation in data science concepts and tools. This program provided me with in-depth knowledge of essential data science principles and the practical skills needed to tackle real-world data analysis challenges across industries, academia, and government.

I gained a solid foundation in statistical concepts, including probability, inference, and modeling. More importantly, I learned how to apply these concepts in implementing machine learning models. 

The hands-on approach and real-world case studies made the learning process engaging and relevant. For example, I explored trends in global health, US crime rates, the financial crisis of 2007-2008, and even practical applications like building movie recommendation systems or analyzing sports data inspired by "Moneyball." These case studies helped me grasp the real impact of data science in various fields.

Here is the record of the program including the grades I received for each course:

There are two capstone projects that I finished for this program. First is a movie recommendation system and the second one is a wine quality classification model.
