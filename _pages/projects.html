<h2>Causal Analysis Project</h2>
<p>I am working on a causal analysis project that measures the impact of the ASEAN Smart Cities Network on urban development. 
The quantitative research is done using the General Synthetic Control Method, supported by relevant qualitative research. 
Since it is still a work in progress, I have not shared the report here, but in case you are interested to discuss it with me, 
feel free to contact me via email or other chanells.</p>
